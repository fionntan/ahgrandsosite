I heard this tune on Ian Lynch’s wonderful podcast [Fire Draw Near](~https://campsite.bio/firedrawnear~).  

Wonderful, as in, the podcast is literally full of wonders. Wonder about the songs, where they came from and how they pass through people and time. Wonder about the singers, who they are and where they got the gift of their beautiful voices. And mainly wonder how Ian keeps finding such class tunes!

I'm usually floored by at least a couple of songs on each episode. And one in particular on [Episode XIII](~https://soundcloud.com/firedrawnear/fire-draw-near-episode-xiii~) was **Pat Maguire** by [Frank Harte](~https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Harte~)[^1] and [Dónal Lunny](~https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dónal_Lunny~)[^2].

I’ll often try and hunt down the lyrics of folk songs I like. Not out of any ability to sing them well. More just to enjoy them as a story and imagine the characters and setting. 

However, for *Pat Maguire* I couldn’t find the words out there on the great wide googles. So I decided to sit down and do a service for all of ye and transcribe them and post them. 
 
And here they are. 

**'Pat Maguire' by Frank Harte**

*You lads that have your liberty*\
*Well I hope you will draw near*\
*And likewise pay attention*\
*To the few lines I have here*\
*I am here alone far from my home*\
*From the land I do adore*\
*Where both night and day I pine away*\
*Since I left the shamrock shore*

*It was my cruel landlord*\
*That I must blame for all*\
*He took from me my farm of land*\
*Although it was but small*\
*I paid my rent and taxes but*\
*He forced me out for to roam*\
*And to leave the land where I was born*\
*Called Éireann’s lovely home*
 
*I went unto the landlord and*\
*I this to him did say*\
*Why do you dispose me sure*\
*I am clear with you ’til May*\
*With his agent nigh, he did reply*\
*No longer need you wait*\
*For I’ll tumble all small houses down*\
*That stand on my estate*
 
*I was full of grief and without relief*\
*When I homeward took my way*\
*To tell my aged parents what*\
*The landlord had to say*\
*When I related all to them*\
*Sure our cries did render the earth*\
*And my aged father also wept*\
*And he tore his old grey hair*

*And the day of our eviction sure*\
*It was a dreadful sight*\
*The sheriff and the landlord came*\
*All along with all of their might*\
*They knocked on the roof and windows*\
*And they put us all to flight*\
*And then left us there out behind the ditch*\
*On the cold and winter’s night*

*My father and my mother too*\
*Well they died the following day*\
*And after I had buried them*\
*Well I swore without delay*\
*I’d kill the man that took my land*\
*And caused my sad downfall*\
*I would him shoot before I go*\
*And leave old Donegal*

*Now when this was done I then rode on*\
*But I chanced to look behind*\
*A polisman was pursuing me*\
*On a horse more swift than mine*\
*Come stand your ground young man he said*\
*You will not escape from me*\
*For I saw you shoot the landlord dead*\
*From behind the old oak tree*

*Well I told him how he had used us with*\
*A heart as hard as steel*\
*And how he turned my family out*\
*Into an open field*\
*Three times I asked him to pass me by*\
*But this he would not do*\
*So I gave one shout for liberty*\
*Then I boldly shot him too*

*My name is Pat Maguire*\
*I am a shoemaker by trade*\
*I am one of Molly’s darling sons*\
*That was never once afraid*\
*And if every man in Paddy’s land*\
*He would say his prayers like me*\
*We’d be rid of those cursed landlords and*\
*Old Ireland would set free*

[^1]: I read this page wondering why this lesser-known folk singer had such a full biography on Wikipedia. So I checked who added the information. Turns out it’s some legend pensioner called [Patrick](~https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Pdebee~) who lives by the Welsh coast. He’s edited literally **hundreds** of musicians’ pages, along with a heap of other stuff. Blessed be the unsung Wikipedia editors, that’s what I say.

[^2]: Was unsure what Dónal did on this song as I couldn’t hear him playing. However, [Ian let me know through Twitter](~https://twitter.com/oneleg_oneeye/status/1334051221896884225~) that “Dónal Lunny played accompaniment on about half the songs on this album (The Hungry Voice), but this song wasn’t one of them…”.
